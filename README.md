# Chemical age script

This is a simple Python script to find the 'chemical' age in monazites analized by
electron microprobes. The script solve the following equation



that relates the age (in years) and the concentrations (in parts per million) of Th and U
with the total radiogenic Pb iteratively using a bisection search approach. It returns 
the age in million years.
